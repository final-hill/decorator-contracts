@override needs to test input for use in non-TS environments. assert(isFunction) and such

does an @override member return a value as expected?

overrides
 writable | configurable | enumerable verification

Does the typescript 4.3 override feature not cover these use cases? Therefore does not subsume this
library feature?

Strengthening/weakening in contract subtypes:

"""
The notions of “stronger” and “weaker” are formally defined from logic: P1 is said to be
stronger than P2, and P2 weaker than P1, if P1 implies P2 and they are not equal. As every
proposition implies True, and False implies every proposition, it is indeed legitimate to
speak of True as the weakest and False as the strongest of all possible assertions.
""" -- meyer p. 358

in LSP:
"""
Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
 <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/364713/liskov-principle-subclasses-can-have-stronger-invariants-how-could-it-work>
History constraint (the "history rule"). Objects are regarded as being
 modifiable only through their methods (encapsulation). Because subtypes may
 introduce methods that are not present in the supertype, the introduction
 of these methods may allow state changes in the subtype that are not
 permissible in the supertype. The history constraint prohibits this. It
 was the novel element introduced by Liskov and Wing. A violation of this
 constraint can be exemplified by defining a mutable point as a subtype of
 an immutable point. This is a violation of the history constraint, because
 in the history of the immutable point, the state is always the same after
 creation, so it cannot include the history of a mutable point in general.
 Fields added to the subtype may however be safely modified because they are
 not observable through the supertype methods. Thus, one can derive a circle
 with fixed center but mutable radius from immutable point without violating LSP.

 It is not the job of a stack module to deal with error messages,
 which are a user interface issue. Stack modules should deal with the
 efficient implementation of stack operations. To keep the body of top
 simple and convincing, the precondition not empty must be assumed
