The license for this library is AGPL-3.0-only and [exceptions may be sold](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions)
for commercial and other private use. A CLA is also not currently defined.

When these issues are resolved and more formalized contributions will then be accepted with the
appropriate caveats.
